## Purpose of Repo
---

Noted that when I work on projects I inevitably learn a lot. I have a tendance to take note of articles I read. 

I'll categorize these link in various markdown files across my repositories. 

With this repo I'm looking to centralize that. 

The Idea being that as part of rapping a project: will be to catalogue the learnings here. 

For :
* reference 
* later use or 
* as a personal progress reflection.
